#### Algorithm
```
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8 
....
....
....
and sum of even numbers of algorithm
```

1. Assign 1 to prev and next and 0 total sum
2. while prev is less than 4million(4000000)
3. Check even number and add it to total
4. prev = next
5. next = prev + next
6. Print total
